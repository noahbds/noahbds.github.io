    "Student in the preparatory year for the Master of Science at Epitech (Class of 236 - 2025-2028), I am looking for a 33-month apprenticeship in cybersecurity (possible start from January 2026). With an atypical profile combining three years of sociology studies and Epitech's project-based technical training, I possess dual technical and behavioral expertise valuable in a sector where the human factor is critical. My experiences at McDonald's, Debflex, and Carrefour Market have developed my skills in crisis management, communication, and working under pressure. Rigorous, adaptable, and fluent in English, I wish to contribute to incident analysis, user awareness, and vulnerability auditing by bringing a holistic security vision integrating technological and human dimensions.",
